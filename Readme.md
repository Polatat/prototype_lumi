# LuminaGen AI

LuminaGen AI is an AI-driven platform designed to act as a digital assistant for genetic counselors. The name "LuminaGen" combines "Light" and "Gene" to emphasize its goal of bringing illumination and clarity to complex genetic data.

The AI was developed to address several key issues in Thailand, including the severe shortage of genetic specialists, the heavy workload of existing medical personnel, and the difficulty of communicating complex genetic information to patients.

### How It Works

The platform takes a patient's Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data as input and uses deep learning algorithms to automatically analyze and interpret genetic variants against international databases like ClinGen, gnomAD, and OMIM.

* **For Medical Professionals**: LuminaGen AI generates a technical report with "Key takeaway" summaries to help speed up decision-making, along with a statistical report that includes metrics like Polygenic Risk Score.

* **For Patients**: The platform uses a Natural Language Processing (NLP) module to translate complex technical terms and statistics into simple, easy-to-understand Thai, supplemented with infographics to explain disease pathways and inheritance.

The ultimate goal of LuminaGen AI is to reduce the workload for doctors, improve doctor-patient communication, and elevate the quality of genetic healthcare services in Thailand.
